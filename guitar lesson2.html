            <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
            <p>In the fourth part of the beginning piano series we're going to take a look at the left hand. Up until now, the left hand played the bass note corresponding to the name of the chord, so if your right hand was playing an F major, your left hand would play the "F" note. But this doesn't have to be the case! I'm going to show you how you can play other notes as well, and how to "tell a story" and build an actual melody that makes sense with the bass you're playing. Let's get started!

            <h3>Lesson 5</h3>
            <p>In the fifth installment of the piano for beginners series, I'll teach you a nifty way of accompanying yourself on the piano that adds a lot of drive and animation to your playing. We'll do this by emulating the way guitar players strum their guitars.

            <h3>Lesson 7</h3>
            <p> In the seventh installment in this series we'll look at an often-neglected but very important tool every pianist should know: the sustain pedal. When to use it, how to use it, and more importantly: when not to use it.
